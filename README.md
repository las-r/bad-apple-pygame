# Bad Apple
The Bad Apple music video loaded frame-by-frame in Pygame.
## Usage
You can get the video frames and audio file from [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/bad_apple_is.7z). While you can modify the Python file to work with the `bad_apple_{frame}` naming style used in the archive, the one in the repository needs the frames to be named just `{frame}.png` with no leading zeros. It also needs the audio file labeled as `song.wav`.

It takes a really long time for the frames to load, so don't expect a snappy click-and-run script.
